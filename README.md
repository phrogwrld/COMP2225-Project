To get the position change for the leaderboard 
take the difference between the current position and the previous position.
If the difference is positive, then the player has moved up the leaderboard.
If the difference is negative, then the player has moved down the leaderboard.
If the difference is zero, then the player has not moved position on the leaderboard.
If the player is not on the leaderboard, then the position change is null.
  
Must use a server to store the leaderboard data and make the changes to the JSON file
since we cant make changes in a browser environment.
